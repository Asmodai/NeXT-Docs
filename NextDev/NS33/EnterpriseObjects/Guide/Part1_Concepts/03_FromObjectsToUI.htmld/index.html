<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Using an instance of the EODatabaseDataSource class supplied with the Framework insulates the user interface from the complexities of database transactions. If an EODatabaseDataSource is sent an <b>insertObject:</b>, <b>deleteObject:</b>, or <b>updateObject:</b> message and no transaction is open, it creates one; all subsequent operations are part of the same transaction until the data source receives a <b>saveObjects</b> message, at which point it commits the transaction.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2"><b>Value Coercion</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A data source has an additional responsibility: Converting the values that are returned when data is edited in the user interface to the appropriate type for use by the corresponding enterprise object. Except in the case of images, these returned values are usually NSStrings.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Value coercion occurs when the controller learns that a value has been edited in the user interface and sends its data source a <b>coerceValue:forKey:</b> message. <b>coerceValue:forKey:</b> takes the key of an enterprise object as its argument, then coerces the value associated with the key to one of the canonical enterprise object value classes (NSNumber, NSString, NSCalendarDate, NSData), or to a custom value class associated with the key. When your data source is an instance of EODatabaseDataSource, the data source uses a model's mapping between attributes and value classes to convert values into the correct type for the enterprise object.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">After the data source converts the value to the appropriate type, the controller delivers the changes to the enterprise object in a <b>takeValuesFromDictionary:</b> message.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">For example, suppose you edit the value of an employee's salary in the user interface. The controller learns of the change and sends its data source a <b>coerceValue:forKey:</b> message in which the class key (<b>salary</b>) associated with the value being coerced is specified as an argument to the method. The data source consults the model and determines that the value class for the</font> <font face="Helvetica" size="+1">salary </font><font face="Times" size="+1">attribute is NSNumber. It converts the string representation of the salary into an NSNumber and returns it to the controller, which applies the new value to the corresponding enterprise object with a <b>takeValuesFromDictionary:</b> message. If the <b>salary </b>property in the enterprise object is an instance variable declared as a scalar type such as <b>double</b>, <b>takeValuesFromDictionary: </b>further coerces the NSNumber object returned from the data source into the specified scalar type.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2"><b>Entity Controllers</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A controller works so closely with its data source that for applications based on a relational database, it's common to use an <i>entity controller</i>, which consists of an EOController pre-connected to an EODatabaseDataSource.

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">EOAssociations are used by a controller to mediate between enterprise objects and the user interface; controllers don't interact with user interface objects directly. An association ties a single user interface object (such as a TextField) to a value corresponding to a key in an enterprise object or objects managed by the controller. For example, a TextField displays a value such as &quot;12-1-93&quot; for an enterprise object key <b>hireDate</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Just as edited values returned from the user interface by an association need to be converted to the appropriate value class type before they can be applied to an enterprise object (as described in &quot;Value Coercion&quot;), an association must convert the value it extracts from an enterprise object to a type that can be displayed by the user interface. With the exception of images, this type is usually NSString.</font>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=106></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Configuring a controller to buffer changes to values allows you to control when those changes are applied. Changes to data occur at three levels in the interface layer: When you edit values in the user interface, when you apply those edited values to enterprise objects managed by an EOController, and when you write the changed enterprise object values to the database. Buffering allows you to cache changes and then apply them as a group, instead of individually.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">EOController offers two types of buffering: <i>edit buffering</i> and <i>operation buffering</i>.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Edit buffering causes a controller to stockpile changes made to enterprise objects until it receives a <b>saveToObjects</b> message. It then delivers the changes to each object in a single <b>takeValuesFromDictionary:</b> message. Buffering edits is useful when related changes must be validated as a whole; for example, if a date has to be within a certain range and its components are entered in separate fields.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Operation buffering causes a controller to stockpile data source operations (that is, insert, update, and delete operations) until it receives a <b>saveToDataSource</b> message. It then sends the operations to the data source and ends with a <b>saveObjects</b> message, which commits the modified objects to persistent storage. Buffering causes changes to be applied in a single transaction, but increases the risk that other applications may make conflicting changes to the same data before your changes are applied.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">When you don't buffer operations, a controller sends the data source an <b>insertObject:</b>, <b>updateObject:</b>, or <b>deleteObject: </b>message immediately after performing a related operation on an enterprise object, followed by a <b>saveObjects</b> message. This approach ensures that the values in enterprise objects are continually synchronized with database data.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You can programmatically set the behavior of edit and operations buffering by using the EOController methods <b>setSavesToObjectsAutomatically:</b> and <b>setSavesToDataSourceAutomatically:</b>. Supplying an argument of YES to these methods <i>turns off</i> buffering for edits and operations, respectively.</font>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">An EOController can be configured to maintain an undo stack, which records changes to enterprise objects. When the controller receives an <b>undo</b> message, it reverses all enterprise object and data source changes back to the last defined undo point, then sends its associations a <b>contentsDidChange</b> message.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Unless you specify otherwise, an undo operation undoes all of the changes on the stack. However, you can use the <b>setMarksEveryOperation:</b> method to direct the controller to mark an undo point for every operation. An operation is delineated by whatever you do to a field before you finish editing its contents. However, you can programmatically set undo marks to reflect a coarser level of edits.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You can further refine the behavior of the undo stack by using the <b>setMaximumUndoMarks:</b> method to limit the number of marks that are recorded. Marks added after the maximum specified amount will cause earlier marks to be discarded. Setting the maximum to zero (the default) allows an unlimited undo stack.</font>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Using Interface Builder to configure interface layer objects greatly simplifies the development process. Much of the work of creating an application (creating a controller and a data source from an entity, connecting to the database, fetching and displaying objects whose values can be edited and persistently stored) is done for you. This approach works well as long as your application meets these conditions:</font></td></tr>
