<td><font face="Times" size="+1">The Enterprise Objects Framework brings the benefits of object-oriented programming to database application development. You can use the Framework to build feature-rich, graphical database applications with reusable software components that tightly couple business information with the business processes managing that information.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">One of the most significant problems developers face when using object-oriented programming languages with SQL databases is the difficulty of matching static, two-dimensional data structures with the extensive flexibility afforded by objects. The features of object-oriented programming--such as encapsulation and polymorphism--and their benefits--like fewer lines of code and greater code reusability--are often negated by the programming restrictions that come with accessing SQL databases within an object-oriented application.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The Enterprise Objects Framework solves this problem by providing tools for defining an object model and mapping it to a data model. This allows you to create objects that encapsulate both data and the methods for operating on that data, while taking advantage of the data access services provided by the Framework that make it possible for these objects to persist in a relational database.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The flexible, three-tier architecture provided by the Framework allows you to build robust, scalable, client/server applications. Objects at each of the three tiers (user interface, enterprise objects, and data store) can be deployed to take advantage of network resources. For example, data might be stored in a relational database running on a fault-tolerant database server with gigabytes of disk storage, while enterprise objects run on high-end compute servers. Partitioning the application to make best use of available resources allows complex applications to achieve maximum performance.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The components of the Enterprise Objects Framework fully embrace the three-tier architecture, which means that portions of the Framework can be used selectively to meet specific application requirements. For example, the components that provide users with the ability to interactively manipulate enterprise objects can be used independently to provide applications with an undo capability. You can use a custom data store (such as a flat-file system) in place of a relational database to store data for enterprise objects. Or you can make use of the database adaptors separate from the rest of the Framework components to provide direct access to relational databases for your applications.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The Enterprise Objects Framework offers these additional benefits:</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Flexibility</b>. An enterprise object isn't constrained by the physical location of data. Its mapping can extend across tables, and its data isn't confined to the object's mapping to a physical database. Further, the mapping of an enterprise object to the database can be dynamically controlled at run time.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Modularity</b>. Depending on the needs of your application, you can create simple applications that require little or no code, program selected components while accepting the default behavior of other components, or use selected components independent of the rest of the Framework.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Extensibility</b>. The Enterprise Objects Framework's classes are public and extensible. For example, you can provide your own data source, or add support for a new user interface object.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">The Enterprise Objects Framework documentation set includes the <i>Enterprise Objects Framework Reference</i> and the <i>Enterprise Objects Framework Developer's Guide</i>. The Reference is divided into three chapters: &quot;The Interface Layer,&quot; &quot;The Access Layer,&quot; and &quot;User Interface Objects.&quot; It includes specifications for all of the Framework classes and protocols.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The <i>Enterprise Objects Framework Developer's Guide</i> (this book) is divided into three parts: &quot;Concepts,&quot; &quot;Application Design,&quot; and &quot;Programming Tasks.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Part 1, &quot;Concepts,&quot; contains chapters that give an overview of the Framework architecture, introduce enterprise objects, and describe how objects are created from the database and displayed in the user interface.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Part 2, &quot;Application Design,&quot; contains chapters that discuss designing enterprise objects, and explain how to use the EOModeler, Project Builder, and Interface Builder applications to create an Enterprise Objects Framework application.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Part 3, &quot;Programming Tasks,&quot; contains chapters that describe basic programming tasks such as connecting to the database, retrieving and modifying records, working across levels of the Framework, working with models, and programming at the interface layer.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2"><b>Entity-Relationship Modeling</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The Enterprise Objects Framework relies heavily on the concepts embodied in traditional Entity-Relationship modeling. Specifically, Entity-Relationship modeling terminology is used by the Enterprise Objects Framework classes to describe the mapping between stored data and enterprise objects.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">For a discussion of these concepts and of relational databases, see the Appendix, &quot;Entity-Relationship Modeling.&quot;</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">The Enterprise Objects Framework is based on the Foundation Kit classes. The Foundation Kit defines a base layer of Objective C classes; it also provides a memory allocation paradigm that's used throughout the Enterprise Objects Framework. Foundation classes have mutable and immutable versions, which allows objects to be used with a minimal consumption of resources. Immutable objects are reference-counted, thereby consuming no extra memory for multiple copies. A basic understanding of the Foundation classes is required for using the Enterprise Objects Framework effectively. For more information, see the <i>Foundation Kit Reference</i>.</font>
