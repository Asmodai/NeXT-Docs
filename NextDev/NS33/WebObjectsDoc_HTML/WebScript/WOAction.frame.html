<H2><A NAME="HDR7"><A NAME="WOAction">Using the WOAction Object in Nested Components</A></A></H2>
<P></B>In the most common case, a component (that is, a unit that's constructed from a script, an HTML template, and a declarations file) corresponds to a single, dynamically generated page in an application. Sometimes, however, one component is nested inside of another. Such components, such as a calendar or a footer component, may be suited for use in a range of different applications.
<P>WebScript provides a mechanism for constructing components that can be reused without having to be rewritten. This mechanism is WOAction, which allows you to separate a user action (such as   clicking on a hyperlink) from the method it invokes. This allows a nested (child) component to be used with different parent components by enabling each parent to respond to the user action in its own way.
<P>The WOAction object allows nested child components to send callback messages to their parents. This is how it works:

<OL>
<P><LI>The parent page declares the component in its declarations file. 
<BR>


<P>For example, the Main page in the Component example (see the WebObjects examples) has this declaration in its <B>Main.wod</B> declarations file:
<PRE>
  PALETTE:Palette {
    selection = number;
    callBack = displaySelection;
  };
</PRE>
<P>The <B>callBack</B> attribute specified in the declaration takes as its value a method (<B>displaySelection</B>) that is triggered when the child component sends the <B>callBack</B> object an <B>invoke</B> message. Through this mechanism the child component is able to message the parent (in this case, the Main page).



<P><LI>The child component's script uses the <B>action</B> keyword to declare that the <B>callBack</B> attribute specified in the parent's declarations file is a WOAction object:
<BR><PRE>
action callBack;
</PRE>

<P><LI>The child component script then sends the WOAction object (in this example, <B>callBack</B>) an <B>invoke</B> message, which tells the object to invoke its associated method (in this example, <B>displaySelection</B>).
<BR>


<P>For example, here's an excerpt from the child component script <B>Palette.wos</B>:
<PRE>
action callBack;

- click {
    selection = digit;
    return [callBack invoke];
}
</PRE>
</OL>
<P>When the user clicks on a digit in the browser, the child component's <B>click</B> method is triggered. This sets the value of the <B>selection</B> variable to the digit the user clicked on. Since the <B>selection</B> variable of the child component is tied to the <B>number</B> variable of the parent (in the <CODE>selection = number</CODE> statement in the declaration), the <B>number</B> variable is modified accordingly. Next, the <B>click</B> method sends the WOAction object <B>callBack</B> an <B>invoke</B> message. This in turn invokes the <B>displaySelection</B> method in the parent's script <B>Main.wos</B>. Finally, the <B>displaySelection</B> method generates a new HTML page that reflects the digit clicked by the user.
<P>  You can use this technique in a single application in which multiple parent components interact with a child component differently. The following statements give examples of what this would entail in the parents' declarations files and the child's script:
<P>
<B>Component declaration in Parent1.wod</B>
<PRE>
COMPONENT:component {
    childVar = parent1Var;
    callBack = endWorldHunger;
};
</PRE>
<P>
<B>Component declaration in Parent2.wod</B>
<PRE>
COMPONENT:component {
    childVar = parent2Var;
    callBack = lookOutForNumberOne;
};
</PRE>
<P>
<B>The associated method in Child.wos</B>
<PRE>
action callBack;

- click 
{
    childVar = newValue;
    return [callBack invoke];
}
</PRE>
