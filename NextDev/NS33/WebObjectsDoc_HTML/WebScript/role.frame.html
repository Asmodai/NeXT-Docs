<H2><A NAME="REF23296">The Role of Scripts in a WebObjects Application</A></H2>
<P></B>In a WebObjects application, a WebScript typically includes the following ingredients:

<UL>
<LI>  Variable declarations

<LI>  The instantiation of objects that get bound to HTML elements

<LI>  Action methods that define a response to user actions

<LI>  Logic for performing page navigation
</UL>


<P>In most cases, a script has a corresponding declarations file and HTML template. The declarations file provides a mapping between the actions and variables defined in the script, and the HTML elements that will be dynamically generated and then substituted in the HTML template.The three files in a group have the same base name but with different extensions; for example, <B>Main.wos</B> (script), <B>Main.wod</B> (declarations), and <B>Main.html</B> (template). These application resources are used by a corresponding WOWebScriptComponentController to prepare responses to user requests. Most commonly a WOWebScriptComponentController represents a single page in a WebObjects application, though one WOWebScriptComponentController can be nested inside of another. 
<P>In a WebObjects application you generally put each group of three files (the script, the declaration, and the HTML template) into a directory that has the same base name and the extension <B>.wo</B>. So, for example, you can have a directory <B>Main.wo</B> that contains the files <B>Main.wos</B>, <B>Main.wod</B>, and <B>Main.html</B>. Each group of three files is called a <I>component</I>. The script associated with a component (in this example, <B>Main.wos</B>) is called a <I>component script</I>.
<H3><A NAME="HDR7">The Application Script</A></H3>
<P>Often, in addition to having multiple components (that is, subdirectories that contain a script, a declarations file, and an HTML template), a WebScript application also has an <I>application script</I>. This script is where you declare and initialize global and session variables. 
<P>  The application script has the name <B>Application.wos</B>, and it resides immediately under the application directory.
