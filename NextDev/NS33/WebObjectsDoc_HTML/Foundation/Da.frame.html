<H2><A NAME="REF60253">Working with NSCalendarDates</A></H2>
<P>NSCalendarDate objects represent dates and times. These objects are especially suited for representing and manipulating dates according to western calendrical systems. NSCalendarDate performs date computations based on western calendrical systems, primarily the Gregorian.
<P>The methods provided by NSCalendarDate are described in more detail in the section <A HREF="Da_M.frame.html#REF32814">Commonly Used NSCalendarDate Methods</A>.
<H3><A NAME="REF29655">The Calendar Format</A></H3>
<P>Each NSCalendarDate object has a calendar format associated with it. This format is a string that contains date-conversion specifiers that are very similar to those used in the standard C library function <B>strftime()</B>. NSCalendarDate interprets dates that are represented as strings conforming to this format. You can set the default format for an NSCalendarDate object at initialization time or using the <B>setCalendarFormat:</B> method. Several methods allow you to specify formats other than the one bound to the object.

<P>The date conversion specifiers cover a range of date conventions:
