<H2><A NAME="REF39363">Foundation Objects</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="REF12159">Types</A></H3>
<P>All the variables you create in WebScript are objects. Consequently, there is only one data type: <B>id</B>. For more information on the <B>id</B> type, see <A HREF="../WebScript/idType.frame.html">The id Data Type</A> in Using WebScript.
<H3><A NAME="REF80490">Sending Messages</A></H3>
<P>To get an object to invoke one of its methods, you send it a message. For example, the following statement:
<PRE>
[colorArray removeAllObjects];
</PRE>
<P>tells the object <B>colorArray</B> to invoke its <B>removeAllObjects</B> method. Message expressions are enclosed in square brackets:
<PRE>
[<I>receiver</I> <I>message</I>];
</PRE>
<P>The receiver is an object and the message is the method you want to invoke and any arguments passed to it. The following are examples of messages with arguments:
<PRE>
[colorArray addObject:newColor];
[colorArray writeToFile:fileName atomically:YES];
</PRE>
<P>In the first statement, <B>newColor</B> is an argument to the method <B>addObject:</B>. In the second statement, <B>fileName</B> and <B>YES</B> are both arguments to the method <B>writeToFile:atomically:</B>.
<P>For more information on messages, see <A HREF="../WebScript/messaging.frame.html">Messaging in WebScript</A> in "Using WebScript."
<H3><A NAME="REF21115">Representing Objects as Strings</A></H3>
<P><I>Forthcoming: a discussion of how to represent all kinds of objects as strings using the <B>description</B> method.</I> 

<H3><A NAME="REF97063">Mutable and Immutable Objects</A></H3>
<P>Some objects are immutable; once they are created, they can't be modified. Other objects are mutable. They can be modified at any time. When you create an object, you can often choose to create it as either immutable or mutable. Three kinds of objects discussed in this chapter---strings, arrays, and dictionaries---have both immutable and mutable versions.
<P>For clarity, it's best to use immutable objects wherever possible. Only use a mutable object if you need to modify its contents after you create it.
<H3><A NAME="REF15824">Determining Equality</A></H3>
<P><I>Forthcoming: a discussion of how to determine if two objects are equal using the <B>isEqual:</B> method.</I>
