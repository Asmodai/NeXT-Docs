    <h1>WebObjects example code is not included in this release.</h1>
    <p>
      The documentation for WebObjects 1.0 includes many examples and was meant to be hosted by a WebObjects-enabled web server.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>These examples have <em>not</em> been included in this release.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      WebObjects 1.0 is available on the second CD-ROM in the Nebula series, as it was originally available on NeXT's FTP server.  If you wish to see example code, please use that CD-ROM.
