<H2><A NAME="HDR0">Writing Hello World</A></H2>
<P>Writing a WebObjects application involves creating a component for each page in the application and installing the components in a directory that's accessible to WebObjects and your Web server.
<P>Hello World has two components---<B>Main</B> and <B>Hello</B>. The component for the first page of a WebObjects application is always named <B>Main</B>. When a user opens the URL for a WebObjects application, the DefaultApp program looks for a component named <B>Main</B> to represent the first page.
<P>Generally, all the components for an application are installed in a single application directory anywhere in <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects</B>. For example, the Hello World application directory is <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects/Examples/HelloWorld</B>.
<P>The only components that might not be installed in an application directory are reusable components used by multiple applications. These reusable components are installed directly under <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects</B> so all applications can access them. Hello World doesn't use any reusable components, so all its components are installed in <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects/Examples/HelloWorld</B>.
<P> <paranum><B>Note: </B> In addition to components, some applications have an application script that creates and manages application-wide resources. Application scripts are installed directly under the application directory and have the name <B>Application.wos</B>. For example, if Hello World had an application script, it would go in the directory <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects/Examples/HelloWorld</B>. For more information on application scripts, see <A HREF="../WebScript/role.frame.html">The Role of Scripts in a WebObjects </A>Application.
<P>A component is represented with a component directory that contains an HTML template, a WebScript file, and a declarations file. In addition to these three files, a component directory may also contain images and other resources used by the component.
<P>The following sections describe the files for the Main and Hello components of the Hello World application.
