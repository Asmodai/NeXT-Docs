<H2><A NAME="HDR0">Where Things Go</A></H2>
<P>WebObjects is installed in a platform-dependent location. The following table summarizes the locations for each different platform:
<P><PRE>
----------------------------------------------
<B>Platform    Installation Directory              
<TableHeadEnd></B>----------------------------------------------
NEXTSTEP    /NextLibrary/WebObjects             
Solaris     /usr/NextLibrary/WebObjects         
Windows NT  &lt;NEXT_ROOT&gt;/NextLibrary/WebObjects  
----------------------------------------------
</PRE>
<P> <paranum><B>Note: </B> On Windows NT, you specify the location of NEXT_ROOT during the WebObjects installation.
<P>The <B>NextLibrary/WebObjects</B> directory, regardless of its location on your system, contains resources required to run WebObjects applications. Within it, you'll find the following subdirectories:

<UL>
<P><LI><I>Executables</I>. This directory contains <B>DefaultApp</B>, a program that runs as a specific WebObjects application. DefaultApp receives incoming requests and responds to them using the resources you provide for a particular WebObjects application.
<BR>
<P><LI><I>cgi-bin</I>. This directory contains <B>WebObjects</B>, a CGI program that handles communication between your Web server and instances of DefaultApp running as specified WebObjects applications.
<BR>
<P><LI><I>Examples</I>. This directory contains several example WebObjects applications.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="WTG_NextLibrary.gif">
</UL>


<P><A NAME="REF71235"> Figure 1  The Contents of <B>NextLibrary/WebObjects</A>
<P></B>Your Web server must be able to access resources in these directories to run the examples and WebObjects applications you write. After installation of WebObjects, your Web server's directories should contain the following links or copies:

<UL>
<P><LI><I>&lt;cgi-bin&gt;/WebObjects</I>: a copy of or link to <B>NextLibrary/WebObjects/cgi-bin/WebObjects</B>.
<BR>
<P><LI><I>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects</I>: a new directory in which WebObjects components are installed.
<BR>
<P><LI><I>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects/Examples:</I> a copy of or link to <B>NextLibrary/WebObjects/Examples</B>.
<BR>
</UL>


<P>Figure 2 illustrates the resources that should be present in your Web server after the WebObjects installation procedure is completed. If any of these links or copies are missing, see the <A HREF="/NextLibrary/WebObjects/ReadMe.html">ReadMe</A> file in <B>NextLibrary/WebObjects</B> for a step you may have missed.
