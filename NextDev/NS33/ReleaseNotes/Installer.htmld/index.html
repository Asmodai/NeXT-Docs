<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Scripting</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The Release 3.0 Installer lets developers add up to four programs (typically shell scripts) to Installer packages.&nbsp; Two of these programs, the &quot;pre_install&quot; and &quot;post_install&quot; programs, will be executed before and after the Install and Expand operations if the programs exist inside the Installer package. Similarly the &quot;pre_delete&quot; and &quot;post_delete&quot; programs, if they exist, will be run before and after Delete and Compress operations.&nbsp; These programs must be written by the developer and can be used for a wide variety of pre- and post-processing tasks.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Localizable Packages</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The Release 3.0 Installer supports localization of Installer packages by letting developers put localized .info files, .tiff files, and installation scripts inside packages, organized by language-specific subdirectories.&nbsp; When a user opens such a package, the information that is displayed in the Installer Package window is read from the .info file and .tiff file that are chosen in the standard way based on the user's language preferences.&nbsp; Also, scripts in localized packages are chosen for execution based on the user's current language settings.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Remote packages</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The Release 3.0 Installer supports &quot;remote packages&quot; whose content archives are stored on public FTP servers.&nbsp; A remote package contains the usual files that make up Installer packages (including scripts and localized files) except for the package archive (the .tar.Z file), which is not contained in the remote package, but instead is stored remotely on a machine that services anonymous FTP access. Remote packages are small since they don't contain the package contents, and hence can be mailed or posted electronically without major resource consumption.&nbsp; A user that receives a remote package via electronic mail or bulletin board can install the package in the usual way by opening the package icon. When installation is performed, an anonymous FTP connection is created to the FTP server and the package contents are retrieved and installed on the user's machine.</font></td></tr>
