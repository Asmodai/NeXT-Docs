<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Of these four, events are by far the most prevalent and important.&nbsp; In fact, the heart of an application is its <i>event loop</i>, the routine that repeatedly checks for the arrival of new events.&nbsp; It's only when the application is running the event loop that it can receive input from the three other sources.&nbsp; Because these four types of input are so closely interrelated, they're discussed together in this chapter.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The chapter begins with an examination of events:&nbsp; their types, components, and how they're distributed to an application.&nbsp; It then discusses the other types of input and how an application coordinates its response to them.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Since most of an application's event processing is done through the Application Kit objects it includes, the close look at events that this chapter provides may at times contain more detail that you'll actually need to get started writing an application.&nbsp; The next two chapters, &quot;Program Structure&quot; and &quot;Program Dynamics,&quot; introduce the Application Kit and its event-handling system.&nbsp; You can either turn directly to those chapters and refer back to this one for background information as needed, or you can read through this chapter first.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Applications on the NeXT computer are driven by the user's actions on the keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; The Window Server treats each user action as an <i>event,</i> which it associates with a window and reports to the application that created the window.&nbsp; For most events, the Window Server sends the event to the application only if the window's <i>event mask </i>permits it.&nbsp; The mask has a different bit set for each type of event the application is interested in.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Pertinent information about each event--such as which character was typed and where the mouse was located--is collected in an <i>event record</i>.&nbsp; When an event is reported to an application, its record is stored in a C structure and made available to the application through the Application Kit.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Since an application and the Window Server are separate processes that execute asynchronously, a system is needed to coordinate their communication.&nbsp; For example, an application may be involved in a long computation and momentarily unable to process the event records that the Window Server sends.&nbsp; So that no information is lost, as event records are received in the application, they're temporarily placed in storage called the <i>event queue</i>.&nbsp; When the application is ready to process an event, it takes an event record from the queue.&nbsp; Only when the application checks the queue can it also check for timed entries or data at a Mach port or in a file.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Most events follow the same path:&nbsp; from the Window Server to the application's event queue, and from there, to the objects and functions of the application.&nbsp; However, the Application Kit can create an event record and insert it into the event queue for distribution or send it directly to its destination.&nbsp; In some cases, it's more efficient or convenient for the Application Kit to create an event record itself.&nbsp; The Kit can then either insert the record in the event queue for distribution or send it directly to its destination.&nbsp; If an event follows one of these alternate pathways, it's pointed out in the discussion that follows.</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Mouse-dragged and mouse-moved events are generated repeatedly as long as the user keeps moving the mouse.&nbsp; If the user holds the mouse stationary, neither event is generated until it moves again.&nbsp; Nevertheless, mouse-dragged and mouse-moved events are different from all other events in that they report continuous rather than discrete user actions. They therefore place a heavy load on the system; applications should ask for them only when necessary.&nbsp; The default event mask for a newly created window doesn't allow either of these two mouse events.&nbsp; You need to reset the mask when you're ready to respond to these events and set it back again when you're done.&nbsp; See &quot;Modal Event Loops&quot; in Chapter 7 for an example of how this can be done.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Note:</b></font>&nbsp; <font face="Times" size="+1">The use of the terms &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; above is a matter of convention (see Chapter 2, &quot;NeXT User Interface&quot; for more information).&nbsp; Unless the mouse buttons have been differentiated using the Preferences program, either mouse button generates the &quot;left&quot; version of these mouse events.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, a user unlinks the two buttons, the primary mouse button (either left or right) generates &quot;left&quot; mouse events and the other button generates &quot;right&quot; mouse events.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Timer Events</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A <i>timer event</i> notifies an application that a certain time interval has elapsed.&nbsp; An application can register that it wants timer events and that they should be placed in its event queue at a certain frequency.&nbsp; When the application no longer needs them, the flow of timer events can be turned off.&nbsp; An application can't have more than one stream of timer events active at a time.&nbsp; These events are a service of the routines that place events in an application's event queue and so aren't created by the Window Server.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Timer events provide a way for applications to interleave two activities.&nbsp; For example, consider automatic scrolling. As the user drags the mouse outside a window, the application checks for mouse-dragged events and sends a message to select and scroll the contents of the window.&nbsp; The number of lines scrolled at a time depends on the distance the mouse is dragged way from the top or bottom edges of the window:&nbsp; The farther it's dragged, the greater the number of lines scrolled at a time.&nbsp; However, the sending of scrolling messages can't be contingent on the receipt of mouse-dragged events.&nbsp; If the user stops moving the mouse but continues to hold the mouse button down, the flow of mouse-dragged events stops although the window should continue scrolling.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To solve this problem, the application can specify that, while it's checking for mouse-dragged events (whether it finds one or not), it will receive timer events at a given interval.&nbsp; Each time it receives a timer event, it can send a message to the window to scroll.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Cursor-Update Events</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A <i>cursor-update</i> event informs an application that the cursor has crossed the boundary of a predefined rectangular area within a window.&nbsp; The application can then respond by updating the cursor's shape.&nbsp; For example, the Edit application changes the cursor from an arrow to an I-beam whenever the cursor is within the text area of the window.&nbsp; There may be one or more rectangles defined at a time, and the rectangles can overlap partially or fully.&nbsp; A different cursor can be defined for each rectangle.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Cursor-update events may seem closely related to mouse-entered and mouse-exited events.&nbsp; In fact, the Application Kit converts specially marked mouse-entered and mouse-exited events into cursor-update events and then sends them on to the application.&nbsp; Consequently, these events are only available to applications based on the Kit.&nbsp; The Kit also provides the facilities for registering a cursor and assigning it to a particular area of a window.&nbsp; Once your application has assigned a cursor to a specific area, the Application Kit does the rest.&nbsp; Kit routines check for incoming cursor-update events and update the cursor's image accordingly.&nbsp; In doing so, the Kit consumes the cursor-update events, making it unnecessary for your code to handle them.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Kit-Defined Events</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Kit-defined events contain information that the Application Kit uses to manage your application.&nbsp; Since the Kit is designed to respond to events of this type, the code you write will rarely need to take them into account.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A kit-defined event is a compound event, a single event type that serves as a vehicle for various subevents.&nbsp; By examining the event record of a kit-defined event, an application can determine which of several kit-defined subevents has occurred.&nbsp; These subevents report changes to a window or to the status of the application that created the window.

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To convert a variable event type to a mask, you can use the macro NX_EVENTCODEMASK, also from <b>dpsclient/event.h</b>.&nbsp; For example, NX_EVENTCODEMASK(NX_KEYUP) is the same as NX_KEYUPMASK.&nbsp; If <b>someEvent</b> is an event record, NX_EVENTCODEMASK(someEvent.type) is a mask for its type.</font>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Events are returned from the Window Server over a bidirectional communication channel.&nbsp; This is the same channel that the application uses to send drawing instructions to the Server.&nbsp; Chapter 4, discusses this interface to the Window Server and the various kinds of data that pass from the application to the Server.&nbsp; This section introduces some of the functions that access the data returned from the Window Server.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">As the Window Server creates each event record, it's dispatched to the application process.&nbsp; When the event record arrives in the application process, it's added to the application's event queue.&nbsp; The event queue is a ring buffer that can hold a maximum of 50 events.&nbsp; The queue created and maintained by routines defined in the library <b>libNeXT.a</b>.&nbsp; This library includes the basic Display PostScript client library along with extensions that support the NeXT window system.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">For applications based on the Application Kit, event records are taken from the queue and returned to the application whenever the main event loop is executing.&nbsp; If event records are consistently added to the queue faster than the application can remove them, the capacity of 50 records can be reached.&nbsp; Although this rarely happens, if it does a new event record replaces the oldest one in the queue.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The events the application finds are distributed by Kit objects and can be accessed by the custom objects you create. Your custom objects can also preempt the normal distribution process if necessary.&nbsp; (See Chapter 7 for more information on event handling in the Application Kit.)&nbsp; Since the Application Kit has a structure for accessing events and defines object-oriented interfaces for the event handling most applications need, in most cases programmers using the Kit shouldn't make direct calls to the underlying event-handling functions.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Applications that don't use the Application Kit must access the event queue directly.&nbsp; The functions that check the event queue are <b>DPSGetEvent()</b> and <b>DPSPeekEvent()</b>.&nbsp; <b>DPSGetEvent()</b> retrieves a specific type of event from the queue; <b>DPSPeekEvent()</b> simply checks to see if a specific type of event is present.&nbsp; Each function has a <i>timeout </i>argument that determines how long it will wait for an event before returning.&nbsp; <b>DPSDiscardEvents()</b> removes an event of a specific type from the event queue.&nbsp; An application can add an event to the beginning or end of its own queue using <b>DPSPostEvent()</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Two low-level functions that might be used by both Kit and non-Kit applications are <b>DPSSetEventFunc()</b> and <b>DPSSetTracking()</b>.&nbsp; <b>DPSSetEventFunc()</b> lets you establish an event filter for a particular context.&nbsp; When the Window Server sends an event to the application, it is examined by the filter function.&nbsp; Depending on the filter function's return value, the event is then either discarded or added to the event queue.&nbsp; This allows your application to single out certain events for special processing before letting them enter the event queue.&nbsp; <b>DPSSetTracking()</b> affects how multiple mouse-dragged and mouse-moved are treated in the event queue.&nbsp; As an optimization, a string of mouse-dragged or mouse-moved event records can be coalesced into a single event record.&nbsp; For example, the event queue can fill with numerous mouse-dragged events when the user drags the mouse rapidly.&nbsp; Rather than process each event separately, applications by default coalesce these events into a smaller number of similar events. <b>DPSSetTracking()</b> lets you turn off this behavior in case it's important for your application to receive each event.&nbsp; A drawing program, for instance, might need each discrete event so that it can accurately follow the trajectory of the user's mouse movements.&nbsp; Note, however, that by turning off event coalescence, your application runs a greater risk of overrunning the capacity of the event queue.</font>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">For each service, you register a function that you want called when the corresponding condition is met.&nbsp; For example, <b>DPSAddPort()</b> requires a function to call when a message arrives at a Mach port.&nbsp; The function is called only if there's work for it to do--the timed entry must be due, a message must have been received at the port, data must be ready to read from the file.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The registered functions take different arguments depending on which service has been requested.&nbsp; However, they have an argument in common:&nbsp; one of type <b>void *</b>.&nbsp; You can use this generic pointer to pass information to the function. For example, you might use it to pass the <b>id</b> of an object within your application that the function should send a message to.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">When an application requests one of these services, it must also assign it a priority level.&nbsp; Before a condition is checked, its priority level is compared to a threshold assigned by the application.&nbsp; The condition is checked (and the registered function called) only if its priority is equal or greater than the threshold.&nbsp; By temporarily raising the threshold, an application can defer processing input from other sources in favor of processing events.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Executing Timed Entries</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A <i>timed entry</i> is a function you specify to be called at a given frequency.&nbsp; If your application includes a timed entry, the system checks the entry's status (assuming its priority level qualifies it) whenever the application accesses the event queue.&nbsp; If the specified period of dormancy has elapsed, the timed entry is executed.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Applications can use timed entries for various ends.&nbsp; For example, the Application Kit's Text class employs a timed entry to blink the cursor.&nbsp; The Application Kit also uses a timed entry to insert timer event records into the requesting application's event queue.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You register a function as a timed entry by calling <b>DPSAddTimedEntry()</b>.&nbsp; The arguments to <b>DPSAddTimedEntry() </b>are the function to be called, the time interval between calls, an arbitrary piece of data to be passed to the function, and a priority level.&nbsp; Since you can have more than one function registered as a timed entry within an application, each call to <b>DPSAddTimedEntry()</b> returns a unique registration number.&nbsp; When a specific timed entry is no longer needed, it's eliminated by calling <b>DPSRemoveTimedEntry()</b> with the timed entry's registration number.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">For example, consider a simple function that prints a character that's passed to it.&nbsp; To be used as a timed entry, the function would need a declaration of this type:</font>

<td><font face="Helvetica" size="+2"><b>Interval Variability</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">It's important to realize that the interval you set for the timed entry is only a request to the system; the actual interval depends on several factors.&nbsp; Foremost among them is that a timed entry is called only when the application is waiting for events.&nbsp; If one of your program's routines involves a long computation, no timed entry will be executed until the routine finishes the computation and returns control to the main event loop.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Once an application is free to check for a timed entry, several other factors come into play.&nbsp; It's obviously futile to specify a period of 1 second for a function that, when called, has an execution duration of 2 seconds.&nbsp; Less obvious is the problem caused by the interaction between multiple timed entries.&nbsp; If your application involves two timed entries, one of short duration and period and another of long duration, the execution of the first timed entry will be periodically delayed by the execution of the second.&nbsp; As the number of timed entries increases, so too does the possibility for interference among them.&nbsp; In a similar fashion, the execution of a timed entry can be delayed if the application is also processing a message at a Mach port or data at a file descriptor.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Another factor affecting the frequency of timed-entry execution is the resolution of the system clock.&nbsp; A timed entry having a period approaching the clock's resolution will experience a proportionately greater variability in its true period than a timed entry having a much longer period.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Finally, because your application is running within a multitasking operating environment, it's periodically suspended to allow execution time for other processes.&nbsp; When your application restarts, a timed entry may be overdue for execution. For some purposes, such as blinking an image, process suspension is of little consequence.&nbsp; For others, such as the simulation of the movement of a real object, you need to design the timed entry in a more sophisticated way to compensate for periodic process suspension.&nbsp; One strategy for simulations of this type is to design the timed entry so that it calculates the state of the simulated object relative to the absolute system time, which, as shown in the example above, is passed as an argument to the function.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">For example, consider two designs for a timed entry that draws the path of an object moving at a constant speed.&nbsp; In the first case, when the timed entry is called, it simply increments the object's coordinates and redraws the object.&nbsp; This strategy doesn't take into account that the application process will be suspended periodically during its execution. Consequently, the object's position as a function of time won't be accurate.&nbsp; In the second case, each time the timed entry is called, it checks the system time and determines the elapsed time since the start of the simulation.&nbsp; It then calculates the object's displacement from the starting point and draws the object in this new position.&nbsp; Although the object's motion will not be entirely smooth, this technique preserves the relationship between time and distance.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Checking Mach Ports</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">An application can use a Mach port as a conduit for communication with other applications.&nbsp; (For information on Mach and Mach ports, see the <i>NeXT Operating System Software</i> manual.)&nbsp; Applications receive messages of various types at Mach ports; for example, when the Workspace Manager needs an application to open a file, it sends an appropriate message to one of the application's Mach ports.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The function <b>DPSAddPort()</b> adds a port to the list of ports that the application can check when it's getting events.&nbsp; It also registers a function to be called when a message is received.&nbsp; Other arguments are the message's maximum size, a pointer to user-defined data, and a priority level.&nbsp; Again, the function call is contingent on the function's assigned priority level.&nbsp; When an application no longer needs this service it calls <b>DPSRemovePort()</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You'll rarely need to manage Mach ports and messages directly; the Application Kit furnishes a more convenient object-oriented interface to these services.&nbsp; It provides applications with the Mach ports they need to communicate with the Workspace Manager and with other applications.&nbsp; The Application Kit also defines classes that you can use to create and monitor any additional ports your application may require.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Checking File Descriptors</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Applications can also communicate by sending data to, or receiving it from, a file.&nbsp; The file (which may represent a disk file, a socket, a device, or some other file type) is represented by an integer called a file descriptor<i>.</i>&nbsp; <b>DPSAddFD() </b>adds a file descriptor to the list of those the application checks (depending on priority level) each time it attempts to retrieve an event.&nbsp; Other arguments specify a function to be called to read the data from the file, a pointer to some user-defined data to be passed to this function, and a priority level.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Most UNIX commands are designed to take their input from one file and write their output to another.&nbsp; In addition, peripheral devices such as terminals and printers are represented by files.&nbsp; Given the design of the UNIX operating system, checking file descriptors provides your application with a general interface to other programs and devices.&nbsp; For example, your application could monitor a file descriptor to check for error messages generated during the compilation of another program.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Scheduling</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Whether a timed entry is called, or a port or file descriptor is checked, depends largely on the priority level assigned to the registered function.&nbsp; The priority level is an integer from 0 to 30, with 30 as the highest possible priority and 0 as the lowest.&nbsp; The priority of a function is set when it's first registered (with the <b>DPSAddTimedEntry()</b>, <b>DPSAddPort()</b>, and <b>DPSAddFD()</b> functions).</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Whenever an application checks for an event, it specifies a priority threshold.&nbsp; Registered functions with priorities lower than the threshold are screened out; all those with equal or higher priorities are checked at least once to see whether they should be called.&nbsp; If an application has to wait for an event to arrive in the queue, it's possible for a function to be checked and called many times over.&nbsp; Even if there's no wait, all functions at or above the threshold will be checked once.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In general, applications ask for events at a threshold of 1, which ensures that functions registered with a priority level of 1 or above will be called.&nbsp; The highest threshold an application can specify is 31, and the highest priority level for a function is 30.&nbsp; Thus, specifying a threshold of 31 prevents any registered function from being called, without regard for its priority level.&nbsp; Assigning a function a priority level of 0 effectively blocks it from ever being called, without regard for the current threshold.&nbsp; For more information on the use of thresholds in the Application Kit, see &quot;Scheduling&quot; in Chapter 7.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Note:</b></font>&nbsp; <font face="Times" size="+1">A function's priority level is compared only to the threshold, not to the priorities of other functions.&nbsp; If two functions have priorities at or above the threshold, it doesn't matter that one may have a priority of 29 and the other a priority of 10.&nbsp; Both will be scheduled equally.</font></td></tr>
