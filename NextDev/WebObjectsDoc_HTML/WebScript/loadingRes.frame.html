<H2><A NAME="HDR7"><A NAME="resources">Loading Application Resources</A></A></H2>
<P></B>WebScript supplies a special method for loading external resources into your application: the WOApplication method <B>pathForResource:ofType:</B>. This method takes a path and the resource file's extension as arguments: 
<PRE>
id filePath = [WOApp pathForResource:@"DataFiles/MyData" ofType:@"string"];
</PRE>
<P>where <B>DataFiles</B> is a directory (which in this case is immediately under the application directory), and <B>MyData.string</B> is a file in that directory.
<P>Once you load a resource you can use it within your application, for example to initialize another object:
<PRE>
id aString = [NSString stringWithContentsOfFile:filePath];
</PRE>
<P>There are no restrictions on the type of file you load into your application using <B>pathForResource:ofType:</B>--- you can use it to load images, sound files, data files, and so on.
