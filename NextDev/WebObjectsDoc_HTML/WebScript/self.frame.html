<H2><A NAME="REF29325"><A NAME="self">What is self?</A></A></H2>
<P></B>In WebScript, <B>self</B> is available in every method. It refers to the object (either the WOApplication object or the WOWebScriptComponentController object) associated with a script. When you send a message to <B>self</B>, you're telling the object associated with the script to perform a method that's implemented in the script. For example, suppose you have a script that implements the method <B>giveMeARaise</B>. From another method in the same script you could invoke <B>giveMeARaise</B> as follows:
<PRE>
[self giveMeARaise];
</PRE>
<P>This tells the WOApplication or WOWebScriptComponentController object associated with the script to perform its <B>giveMeARaise</B> method.
