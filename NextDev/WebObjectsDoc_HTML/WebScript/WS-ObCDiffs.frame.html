<P></B>WebScript uses a subset of Objective-C syntax, but its role within an application is significantly different. The following table summarizes some of the differences.
<PRE>
Objective-C  				WebScript
_____________________________________________________________________________

Is compiled  				Is interpreted

Supports primitive C data types    	Only supports the id data type

Requires method prototyping  		Doesn't require method prototyping
 					(that is, you don't declare methods 
					before you use them)

Usually includes a .h and a .m file  	Usually has corresponding declarations
 					and HTML template files (unless it is
					an application script)

Supports all C language features  	Has limited support for C language 
					features; for example, doesn't support 
					structures, pointers, enumerators, or 
					unions
					
Methods not declared to return void   	Methods aren't required to include a
must include a return statement  	return statement
 
Has pre-processor support  		Has no pre-processor support---that is,
 					doesn't support the #import or #include
					statements  
_____________________________________________________________________________

<P>Perhaps the most significant difference between Objective-C and WebScript is that in WebScript, the only valid data type is <B>id</B>. Some of the less obvious implications of this are:

<UL>
<P><LI>You can't use methods that take non-object arguments (unless those arguments are integers or floats, which WebScript converts to NSNumbers). For example, in WebScript the following statement is invalid:
<PRE>
// NO!! This won't work.  
string = [NSString stringWithCString:"my string"];
</PRE>


<P><LI>You can only use the "at sign" character (@) as a conversion character with methods that take a format string as an argument:
<PRE>
// This is fine.
[self logWithFormat:@"The value is %@", myVar];
    
// NO!! This won't work.
[self logWithFormat:@"The values are %d and %s", var1, var2];
</PRE>


<P><LI>You shouldn't supply any type information for a method's arguments and return types. These types are assumed to be <B>id</B>, and if you supply any type information, you will get an error.
<PRE>
// This is fine.
- aMethod:anArg {
	    
// NO!! This won't work.
- (void) aMethod:(NSString *)anArg {
	    
// This won't work either
- (id)aMethod:(id)anArg {
</PRE>


<P><LI> You need to substitute integer values for enumerated types. 



<P>For example, suppose you want to compare two numeric values using the enumerated type NSComparisonResult. This is how you might do it in Objective-C:
<PRE>
result = [num1 compare:num2];  
if(result == NSOrderedAscending)   /* This won't work in WebScript */
    /* num1 is less than num2 */
</PRE>
<P>But this won't work in WebScript. Instead, you have to use the integer value of NSOrderedAscending, as follows:
<PRE>
result = [num1 compare:num2];  
if(result == -1)  
    /* num1 is less than num2 */
</PRE>
</UL>
