<H1>Introduction</H1>
The WebObjects architecture lends itself to the creation of reusable components. You can design  reusable components that display:

<UL>
<LI>Custom configurations of images, input fields, or frames
<LI>The current number people that have visited a particular page
<LI>Your company's logo and current stock quote
<LI>A Java animation or VRML demonstration
</UL>

The possibilities are endless.<P>

With WebObjects, you design pages from static HTML elements and dynamic WebObjects elements. The HTML template for a page shows how these features are intermixed:

<PRE>
    &lt;CENTER&gt;
    &lt;STRONG&gt;Today's image:&lt;/STRONG&gt; 
	&lt;WEBOBJECT NAME=IMAGE&gt;&lt;/WEBOBJECT&gt; 
    &lt;/CENTER&gt;
    &lt;WEBOBJECT NAME=FOOTER&gt;&lt;/WEBOBJECT&gt;
</PRE>

The portions of the page marked by the WEBOBJECT tags derive their HTML values dynamically.  When this page is requested, WebObjects consults the template's corresponding declarations file:

<PRE>
    IMAGE : WOImage {src = todaysImage;};
    FOOTER : Footer {date = now;};
</PRE>

The first declaration indicates that IMAGE is a WOImage that derives its image data from the invocation of the method <STRONG>todaysImage</STRONG>.  WOImage is one of the fundamental dynamic elements that WebObjects defines. The declaration for FOOTER specifies an element that isn't one of WebObjects' fundamental types--it specifies a <EM>reusable component</EM>.<P>

The Footer reusable component is stored in a directory (named &quot;Footer.wo&quot;) that contains the same configuration of three files (template, declarations, and script files) as you would find for a WebObjects page. Here's what these files contain:<P>

<PRE>

</PRE>
<H4>Footer Template File</H4>
<HR>
<PRE>
    &lt;WEBOBJECT NAME="DATE"&gt;&lt;/WEBOBJECT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
    
</PRE>

<H4>Footer Declarations File</H4>
<HR>
<PRE>
    DATE:WOString {value = formattedDate;};
    
</PRE>

<H4>Footer Script File</H4>
<HR>
<PRE>
    id date;
    
    - formattedDate { 
	id head, tail;
    
	head = [date descriptionWithCalendarFormat:@"%m-%d-%Y"];
	tail = [date descriptionWithCalendarFormat:@"%H:%M:%S"];
	return [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ - %@\n", head, tail];
    }
    
</PRE>

As you can see, the Footer component is simply a string whose contents is dynamically set to be the current date and time. <P>

<H2>Accessing a Reusable Component</H2>
The Footer component can be included on any page of an application simply by:

<UL>
<LI> Adding the WEBOBJECTS tags to the page's HTML template file
<LI> Declaring the component in the page's declarations file
<LI> Installing the component directory where WebObjects can find it
</UL>

WebObjects searches for a reusable component in these places and in this order:

<OL>
<LI> The directory of the current page.  For example, if the template, declarations, and script files for the current page are stored in <STRONG>Page5.wo</STRONG>, WebObjects will look for the component in the directory <STRONG>Page5.wo/Footer.wo</STRONG>.
<LI> The parent directory of the current page.
<LI> Within the <STRONG>WebObjects</STRONG> directory of the server's document root.
</OL>

<H2>More Information</H2>

You've seen how a reusable component can be nested within a component that represents the page.  It's possible for the nested, or <EM>child component</EM>, to invoke methods in its <EM>parent component</EM>. See <A href=../WebScript/WOAction.frame.html>Using the WOAction Object in Nested Components</A> for more information.

Many of the examples that accompany this version of WebObjects make extensive use of reusable components.  See the CyberWind and Component examples in particular.
