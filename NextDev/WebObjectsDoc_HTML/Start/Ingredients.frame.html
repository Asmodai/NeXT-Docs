<H2><A NAME="HDR0">The Ingredients of a WebObjects Application</A></H2>
<P>A typical WebObjects application contains the following ingredients:

<UL>
<P><LI><I>Components</I> that specify the content, presentation, and behavior of an application's pages.
<BR>
<P><LI><I>WebObjects Classes</I> that provide an infrastructure for Web-based applications.
<BR>
<P><LI><I>DefaultApp</I>, a program that runs as a specified WebObjects application. It receives incoming requests and responds to them using the components you provide.
<BR></UL>


<P>WebObjects provides the classes and the DefaultApp. After installing the WebObjects package, they're ready to go.
<P>You provide the components.
<H3><A NAME="HDR1">Components</A></H3>
<P>Components are the part of a WebObjects application that you write. Each component is a collection of files that defines the content, presentation, and behavior of a page. Components are comprised of three files:

<UL>
<P><LI>An <I>HTML template</I> that specifies how the corresponding page looks. HTML templates contain markup elements that define the format for both static and dynamic page content.
<BR>
<P><LI>A <I>script file</I> that implements application behavior specific to the component. Generally, script files declare variables for managing dynamic page content and actions that define responses to user requests.
<BR>
<P><LI>A <I>declarations file</I> that defines a mapping between the HTML template and script variables and actions.
<BR></UL>


<P>The files of a component are organized in a <I>component directory</I>. The name of the directory has the same base name as the name of the component, but it has the extension <B>.wo</B>. For example, the Hello World example has a component named <B>Main</B> and a corresponding component directory named <B>Main.wo</B>.
<P>The template, script, and declarations files in the component directory also have the same base name, and each file type has its own extension. Template files have the extension <B>.html</B>, declarations have the extension <B>.wod</B>, and scripts have the extension <B>.wos</B>. Thus, the <B>Main</B> component has the files <B>Main.html</B>, <B>Main.wos</B>, and <B>Main.wod</B>.

<P> Figure 3  The Contents of a Component Directory
<P> <paranum><B>Note: </B> Not all components represent an entire page. Some components represent only a portion of a page. You can extract common data and functionality from components for whole pages into smaller, reusable components. These smaller components can be nested as subcomponents inside a component representing a whole page. For more information on writing and using reusable components, see <A HREF="../Reuse/Reuse.book.html">Writing Reusable Components</A>.
<H3><A NAME="HDR2">Where WebObjects Components Go</A></H3>
<P>Generally, you put the components of a WebObjects application in a directory with the same name as the application. For example, the Hello World example has a corresponding directory named <B>HelloWorld</B> that contains its component directories.
<P>WebObjects application directories such as the <B>HelloWorld</B> directory can go anywhere under the <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects</B> directory. You can create application directories immediately under <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects</B>, or you can create hierarchies of directories within <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects</B> to organize application directories however you wish.
<P>As shown in Figure 6, the Hello World application directory is located in <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects/Examples</B>.
<P>Reusable WebObjects components used by multiple applications aren't usually kept in application directories. Rather, they are located directly under <B>&lt;DocumentRoot&gt;/WebObjects</B> so they can be accessed by all the applications that use them.
