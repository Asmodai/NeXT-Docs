<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Networking is a way of sharing computer resources among users. These shared resources can include equipment (such as printers and fax modems), files, and data or administrative services. Network servers provide users with access to these resources. For example, a print server lets a work group share a printer. An NFS</font><font size="-1"><sup>&reg;</sup></font><font face="Times" size="+1">file server allows users throughout the network to access files as though the files were on their own local computers. A NetInfo server lets you store administrative data for multiple systems in a single place, reducing the time required to maintain the database.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">NetInfo administration is based on the concept of <i>domains</i>. A NetInfo domain is an abstract collection of administrative information about a group of computers and the resources to which they have access. For example, a NetInfo domain can contain the administrative information for a single computer, a department, or even an entire company. You should associate NetInfo domains with groups of computers that need to be administered together. This is typically along organizational lines--for example, small work groups, departments, or divisions.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">NetInfo domains are linked together in a hierarchy much like the UNIX file system. Each level in the hierarchy is called a <i>domain level</i>. You can make selected information available to specific domain levels. The size and complexity of your network often determines the number of domain levels.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">NEXTSTEP computers come with a set of uncomplicated yet powerful networking applications, called collectively the Manager applications, which reside in the <b>/NextAdmin</b> directory. These applications let you implement your network to meet your requirements. You can set up your network as a hierarchy--perhaps based on your company organization--that lets you share some resources with small groups and make other resources available throughout the network. A printer might be shared among four computers, while a single mail server could route electronic mail to the entire company.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you are using PC type computers based on Intel 486 type CPUs, your choice of expansion card (Ethernet or Token Ring adapter) will dictate which cable to use.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">NeXT computers are designed to communicate over an Ethernet network. Every NeXT computer comes with built-in connectors for both thin Ethernet and twisted-pair Ethernet cables. You can attach your computer to either type of cable. This section explains the advantages and disadvantages of each.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2"><b>Thin Ethernet Cable</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Thin Ethernet coaxial cables consist of a single wire surrounded by an insulator and a shield. With a network based on thin Ethernet cables, your equipment needs are minimal. All you have to do is string the cables, attach the appropriate terminators, and plug in your computer. If cable installation for your system can be done without difficulty, then this solution may be best.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The two main disadvantages of thin Ethernet are that you must install the cables, which requires both expense and effort, and that a single cable problem may jeopardize a portion or even all of your network communication. Often, cables must be installed through walls. However, each site has its unique requirements.</font>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">With these equipment options, you can set up your local work areas with some flexibility in the types of cable you use. For local networking, you could use repeaters to extend your network, or a bridge to combine two thin Ethernet networks. If the Ethernet network uses different types of cable, you could install a repeater, bridge, or router. You could then run thin cable into one end of your equipment and use twisted-pair cable from there on. You can also join thin or twisted-pair cable to an existing thick-coaxial Ethernet cable.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To operate more complex networks with higher traffic, you might use routers. These can be used to create <i>subnets</i>, which are logical divisions of a network into smaller subnetworks. This equipment can give you better administrative control and network performance as your network grows. See Chapter 10 and Appendix C for more information.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A range of solutions is available if you need to extend your network beyond a single building. One important factor is the distance over which you need to extend the network. If you have buildings located close together, you can install fiber optic or broadband cable between them. For example, fiber optic transceivers installed between buildings will allow you to extend the range of your network to approximately 1 1/2 miles at Ethernet speeds (and farther if you add more transceivers). Since you can't easily string wires through city streets, fiber optic transceivers are most useful in a &quot;campus&quot; type of building arrangement, where you can install them away from public areas.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you have tall buildings that are in direct line of sight with each other, you can use a microwave transceiver dish to transmit data. This extends data transmission perhaps 10 to 15 miles. However, if any objects (even a large flock of birds or heavy rain) intrude between the transmitting transceivers, the signal can be interrupted.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Phone lines are a ready solution to data transmission beyond a single building. They go anywhere, and dedicated lines are available for lease. Many networking software applications are available, such as UNIX-to-UNIX Copy (UUCP) and <b>tip</b>, that can be used to transmit data over phone lines. You can transmit data on normal phone lines at speeds from 300 bits per second (bps) to 19200 bps and higher. See Chapter 7 and Chapter 12 for details.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you have the budget and the need, satellites can be used to transmit your data worldwide.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You should also consider linking to existing networks to make use of their resources. A modem and a phone line will put you in touch with the international UNIX-based UUCP network. NEXTSTEP computers also support the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) network that links sites worldwide. The most inexpensive way to access the Internet is to connect to an existing site. In addition, some vendors offer Internet mail gateway services.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In addition to the NeXT 400 dpi Laser Printer and NeXT Color Printer, numerous printers are compatible with NEXTSTEP computers. Because NE XTSTEPcomputers can be used with client software for Novell NetWare</font><font size="-1"><sup>&reg;</sup></font><font face="Times" size="+1">, you can make use of printers attached to NetWare networks. Note that NeXT printers are designed to work only with NeXT computers.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To determine how many printers you need, decide if you want one printer per computer, or if you want to share a printer among several users. In considering these questions, keep in mind that printer needs vary widely among users. For example, a technical publications department uses printers heavily, while some other departments might use printers much less frequently. You might decide to give each writer an individual printer, while setting up a shared printer for low-use departments.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A computer running a <i>NetInfo server</i> process provides storage for and access to a NetInfo database, which corresponds to a particular <i>domain</i>. The NetInfo server process itself manages access to the NetInfo database and keeps track of administrative network information such as user accounts, group membership, host names and addresses, fax modem information, and so on.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The term <i>domain</i> refers to one or more databases that have the same information. A domain can consist of a single database, which is read/write, letting processes update information as well as access information. A domain can consist of two or more databases with the same information, in which case one database is <i>read/write</i> and all others are <i>read only</i>. The read/write database is the master; all others are clones. Thus a domain with two or more databases includes one master and one or more clones. (The master can update the clone databases, so in that respect the clones get written to, but no other process can alter information in a clone, so with respect to network activity, the clones are <i>read only</i>).</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Each database requires a NetInfo server process to manage access. Requests from client processes go to the NetInfo server process for a particular domain. Because clones are exact copies of the master, client requests that happen to access clone NetInfo servers get the same results as if they access the master NetInfo server.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To provide redundancy and reliability of your network, you may wish to set up additional computers to run server processes for the same NetInfo database (called <i>clone servers</i>).</font>

<td><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>File Services</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A computer that provides file services supplies disk storage space for other computers. The Network File System (NFS) is used to share files across the network. A computer running a client process sees the remotely shared directories just like the directories on its own disk. Any computer with a hard disk can be used as a file server, but the more disk storage and memory it has, the better its performance.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">There are different types of file service, and each type can require somewhat different disk and memory configurations. For example, a computer that runs a <i>home directory server</i> process contains the home directories for the users who have logged into other computers. A computer running an <i>applications server</i> process provides a central location for applications for users across the network.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Due to access frequency and the large amount of data storage needed, computers that provide home directory services require either more memory and disk space or fewer users assigned to a single server. Although the requirements may vary, 40 MB of home directory space per person is almost always enough, and as little as 25 MB may be adequate.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Other factors that can increase the disk space and memory needed are the types of applications used. If users process many documents or use sound frequently, they need more memory and disk space. Similarly, users making heavy use of color or video image processing need additional space.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In general, you'll want to set up network-wide user accounts rather than local accounts (enabling users to log into any computer on the network, rather than restricting them to a single computer, and ensuring consisten user identification throughout the network). For details, see Chapter 5, &quot;Managing User Accounts and User Groups.&quot;</font>

Often, only one mail server is needed for an entire company. You can locate the mail server on the same computer that hosts the network NetInfo server.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Although the computer hosting the mail services primarily serves internal mail needs, you can also use it as your network's link to the outside world with a modem link for UUCP hookup, or a leased telephone line, or other outside connections.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">When configuring a computer to run a mail server, use the maximum amount of memory you can afford. Because mail services will probably be storing all mail messages for the entire network, the computer will also need a large disk.</font>
