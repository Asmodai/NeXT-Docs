Remote packages are small since they don't contain the package contents, and hence can be mailed or posted electronically without major resource consumption.&nbsp; A user that receives a remote package via electronic mail or bulletin board can install the package in the usual way by opening the package icon. When installation is performed, an anonymous FTP connection is created to the FTP server and the package contents are retrieved and installed on the user's machine.</font></td></tr>
