<td><font face="Times" size="+1">An <i>Internet address</i> or <i>IP address</i> is simply a 32-bit integer. Addresses are used to uniquely identify individual computers, groups of computers, or entire networks. The address itself is generally written in dotted notation like this: x.x.x.x where each &quot;x&quot; is an integer from 0-255 (called an <i>octet</i>), and each octet represents one byte of the address.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Valid Internet addresses start at 0.0.0.1 and range through 255.255.255.254. Although all Internet addresses contain 4 octets, there are several abbreviations. For example, 127.1 is the same as 127.0.0.1, while 127. is shorthand for 127.0.0.0.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Address Components</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Internet addresses have two components: the network part and the host part. The network part, or network address, identifies a network, while the host part identifies a host on that network. All computers on the same physical network must have the same network address.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Some networks only have a few hosts, and therefore only need a few host addresses, while other networks need many host addresses. Internet addresses are divided into <i>classes</i>, determined by the first (high-order) bits of the address. Each class allocates a specific number of bits for the network part of the address, with the remaining bits used for the host address. The following table describes the primary classes:</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">When talking about the network part of an Internet address, the term <i>network</i> means a set of hosts that can directly communicate with each other. For example, assume there are three different hosts connected with Ethernet cables that have been assigned the addresses 192.42.172.1, 192.42.172.2, and 192.42.178.1. By examining the first octet, you can see that each is a class C address. For two class C addresses to be on the same logical network, the first three octets (24 bits) must match, since only the last octet (8 bits) is used for the host portion. Therefore, the hosts assigned the first two addresses are on the same network, and can communicate with each other, while the third is on a separate network, unable to communicate with either of the first two.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Hosts on different logical networks can communicate with each other if they have access to a <i>router</i>. A router attaches to two or more networks and routes traffic between them. Routers maintain tables of paths to destinations as well as values that approximate the delay of choosing one path over another.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Subnetting</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">A large organization that has (or is planning) hundreds or thousands of hosts will find that the 254 host addresses provided by a class C network are insufficient. A class B network address allows for tens of thousands of host addresses. A network with a large number of hosts will probably be made up of several smaller networks in different locations.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Routers can be used to connect these smaller networks, but remember that routers only transfer data between different logical networks (hosts with addresses that have different network portions). In order for routing to work successfully in this situation, you need to have each smaller network be a different logical network, even though you've been assigned a single network address.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">By using a <i>subnet mask</i>, you can extend the network portion of the Internet address, effectively providing multiple logical networks. A subnet mask (or <i>netmask</i>) determines which bits of an Internet address will be used as the network portion, and which as the host portion. For example, assume you've been assigned the class B network address 140.211.0.0. You've got several sites distributed among different buildings and different cities, each with up to 200 hosts. You set a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, which assigns the first 16 bits to the network portion and 8 bits to the host portion. This gives you the potential for 254 different subnets, each with 254 hosts. You can now, for example, assign one site the network address 140.211.128.0, and another the network address 140.211.192.0.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To see how this works, we need to examine the addresses in binary form:</font></td></tr>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Each bit in a subnet mask set to 1 indicates that the corresponding bit of the Internet address should be considered part of the network portion, while bits set to 0 indicate the host portion. In this example, the first 16 bits of the address have been assigned to you, and the subnet mask extends the network portion to include the next 8 bits, leaving 8 bits for the host portion.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Notice that the two network addresses have been chosen by adjusting the leftmost bits of the third octet. This is a common practice that allows for future expansion. If you find that a subnet needs more than 254 host addresses, you can assign a new subnet mask that leaves more bits available for the host portion. If you had already used some of those bits for the network portion, you would have to reassign host addresses (not a pleasant task). By using the leftmost bits of the third octet for network addresses, you leave the rightmost bits of the address available for possible future use in the host portion.</font>
