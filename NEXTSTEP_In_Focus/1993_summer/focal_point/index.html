<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">This issue, we focus on something that has merited lots of discussion in many forums--NetInfo.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2"><b>A WHOLE ISSUE ON NETINFO?</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">NetInfo is central to NEXTSTEP configuration and networking. The articles in this issue pick up where the NEXTSTEP system administration classes leave off and present information on NetInfo that isn't available anywhere else. There's really no way to learn some of this stuff short of studying the source code, taking the Advanced NetInfo class we've occasionally offered, or talking directly with the NetInfo developers. We hope this issue will be particularly helpful to those who manage large networks.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The feature articles examine various aspects of NEXTSTEP networking in detail. Topics include how the critical pieces of NetInfo information are configured dynamically, how processes look up NetInfo information, what binding is and how it works, how updates are propagated through the network, and how to handle the trickiest things in a network. These articles are detailed and assume you're very familiar with NetInfo.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">There's also an introduction to NetInfo for those who are new to system administration. It covers the basics and helps you get started managing networks.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">And perhaps most important, &quot;NEXTSTEP Networking References&quot; lists additional sources of information, so you can learn more.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2"><b>OTHER GOODIES</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">As in every issue, we also present &quot;Tips &amp; Techniques.&quot; This issue, we look at how to set up a standalone printer using TCP/IP. We also check out how to use the new ftp access to NeXTanswers. For information on contacting NeXT, see &quot;FYI.&quot;</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2"><b>SPECIAL THANKS</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Most of this special NetInfo issue was written by our featured author, Alan M. Marcum. Alan is a technical support engineer in NeXT's Premium Support Team who specializes in designing, implementing, maintaining, and troubleshooting large networks. He's been at NeXT for 5 years and in the industry for over 21 years, so you can bet he knows his stuff!</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Marc Majka also wrote and assisted with this issue's articles. In addition to being a wonderful source of NetInfo information, Marc is a trainer in NeXT Education, and a frequent contributor to <i>NEXTSTEP In Focus</i>.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">We appreciate the fantastic job they and our hard-working technical reviewers (especially Garth Snyder) have done preparing this material!</font>
