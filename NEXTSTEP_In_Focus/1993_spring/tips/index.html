<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2">GETTING HELP FROM NEXTANSWERS</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Want a fast answer to a technical question about NEXTSTEP? Use NeXTanswers, NeXT's new document retrieval system!</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">NeXTanswers has information on many technical topics, including NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors configuration information, articles from <i>NEXTSTEP In Focus</i>, and more. You can request documents by fax or Internet e-mail--the same documents are available either way. Best of all, the service is free.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Here's how to use it.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Using NeXTanswers by fax</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To use NeXTanswers by fax, call the NeXTanswers number--(415) 780-3990--from a touch-tone phone and follow the instructions. You'll be asked for your fax number, a number to identify your fax (like your phone extension or office number), and the ID numbers of the documents you want. When you finish entering the document numbers, hang up and the documents are faxed to you.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To get a list of the available documents, call and request document 1001. Once you receive it, call again to request the documents you want.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Using NeXTanswers by e-mail</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To use NeXTanswers by Internet e-mail, send mail to <b>NeXTanswers@next.com</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To request a specific document, include its ID number in the Subject line or body of the message. To get a list of available documents, include the keyword &quot;INDEX&quot; in the Subject line or body. For complete instructions on using NeXTanswers e-mail, include the keyword &quot;HELP.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You can ask for multiple documents in the same request message. The documents are sent as NeXTmail attachments. If you can't receive NeXTmail, include the keyword &quot;ASCII&quot; in the Subject line or body of the message, and the documents will be sent as ASCII text instead.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you have problems using NeXTanswers, send them to <b>NeXTanswers-request@next.com</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Check it out!</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The next time you have a question about using NEXTSTEP, give NeXTanswers a try. And remember to get a new index now and then--we'll be adding new information that might be just what you need.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>By the way, where's the old NeXTanswers?</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Previously, NeXTanswers was a set of question and answer pairs that covered topics from &quot;What is NEXTSTEP?&quot; to &quot;I got this error message. What's going on?&quot; It has been available at some archive sites and on the <i>support bulletin</i> floppy disk.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">When we decided to make documents available by fax and e-mail, we thought the information in NeXTanswers would be perfect to include. Since we liked the name &quot;NeXTanswers,&quot; we decided to call the whole document retrieval system that.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Of course, then we had to think of a new name for the question-answer pairs. We're calling them &quot;Questions&amp;Answers,&quot; and that's how they're listed in the NeXTanswers index.</font>

<p><br><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2">BUG BATTLING MADE EASIER</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Something's not working, and you <i>know</i> it's not your fault! So, how do you let us know about it?</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">BugNeXT is a bundled application that makes it easier for you to let us know about problems you find in NeXT products, through e-mail. It gathers information from you on the problem, adds information about your particular system, and mails the information to us. Because the information comes in a standardized form, we can more easily use it to determine what the problem is and go about fixing it. You can set up BugNeXT for many users at your site, and each can then file bug reports individually.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Setting up</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">BugNeXT is in <b>/NextDeveloper/Demos</b>. It's part of the Demonstrations package of Release 3.1.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You should set up BugNeXT for the users at your site, and make sure that certain settings in BugNeXT's Preferences match for all users. These settings are explained in BugNeXT's Help, but we'll highlight how to use them here.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><img src="BugNeXTprefs2.gif" width=318 height=284>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><i>Be sure to set BugNeXT Preferences.</i></font>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b><i>Site name</i></b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You need a site name to help identify your site to our Support team. If we've already given your site a name, continue to use that. Otherwise, you can create a unique name. Everyone at your site should use the same site name for consistency.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b><i>E-mail addresses</i></b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To use BugNeXT, you must have Internet e-mail access so BugNeXT can send us the messages. By default, BugNeXT sends mail to the address <b>Bug_NeXT@next.com</b>. If you use a gateway to send mail outside your site, modify the e-mail path field in BugNeXT Preferences to indicate the full path or gateway.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You can also supply a return address so that we can request additional information on the bug if we need to. This reply address can be different for each user sending bugs.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Sending in bugs</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">BugNeXT is simple to use: (1) use the Submit/New menu item to get a Submit window; (2) complete the form; and (3) select Submit to send your report to NeXT. A copy of the report will be sent to you.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">For the Topic, make your best guess, being as specific as you can. If you know only the general area of the problem, select something in the left or middle browser column, like &quot;Mach&quot; or &quot;App Support.&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In the Description, detail the problem as much as you can. If you can reproduce the problem, give the steps. If you cannot reproduce it, say so. Also list any other factors that could be relevant, such as special fonts, modified hardware, whether the machine is a server (NFS, NetInfo, database, and so on), other applications running at the time of the bug, special daemons, and other situations special to your system. If the problem is causing an attention panel to show on your screen, you can select, copy, and paste the text of the message into your report.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">BugNeXT adds a list of your hardware and installed packages in the Description at the bottom, so try to run BugNeXT on the machine on which the problem occurred. If you can't file the report on this machine (for example, if it won't boot), edit the hardware information in the Description to describe the problem machine.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><img src="BugNeXTmainWindow2.gif" width=417 height=405>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><i>The hardware info helps us fix the problem.</i></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In the Summary, summarize the problem in up to 95 characters. Be as descriptive as you can in that space. Usually you don't need to include the name of the application again, since it's in the Topic. Also, don't include words like &quot;bug,&quot; &quot;problem,&quot; &quot;minor,&quot; or &quot;UI&quot;--we can figure that part out, so you can use the space for other details.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>What we do with your bug report</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">When your report arrives here at NeXT, we look it over to see whether it's about a new problem or something we already know about. If it's new, the bug is filed in our database and assigned to a Support engineer who specializes in the topic. The engineer lets you know the bug was received, and tries to duplicate the problem and fix it.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Thanks!</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">We appreciate your sending us information about problems you find--it helps us improve our products and make them more useful to you!</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2">DIVVYING IT UP: HOW TO USE FDISK</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you want to run multiple operating systems on a PC, you need to use NEXTSTEP's <b>fdisk </b>program to divide your disk into partitions. NEXTSTEP <b>fdisk</b> creates up to four partitions, and it's built into the NEXTSTEP installation software so you can partition your disk as you install.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Why a new fdisk?</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">NEXTSTEP <b>fdisk</b> is very similar to the DOS program <b>fdisk</b> in that you can use either to partition disks. However, NEXTSTEP <b>fdisk</b> has features that make it better to use with NEXTSTEP:</font>

<p>

<td nowrap><font face="Times" size="+1"><img src="../../Images/bullet1.gif" width=4 height=8 vspace=3></font></td>

<td width=9></td>

<td nowrap><font face="Times" size="+1"><img src="../../Images/bullet1.gif" width=4 height=8 vspace=3></font></td>

</table>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Installing and fdisk</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">When you install NEXTSTEP, the installation software gives you a few basic choices for setting up your disk, and it uses <b>fdisk</b> to change the partitioning. Here are the basic configurations you can choose:</font>

<p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td nowrap><font face="Times" size="+1"><img src="../../Images/bullet1.gif" width=4 height=8 vspace=3></font></td>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=9></td>

<td nowrap><font face="Times" size="+1"><img src="../../Images/bullet1.gif" width=4 height=8 vspace=3></font></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Make space for both DOS and NEXTSTEP. For this, <b>fdisk</b> divides the disk into two partitions, one for DOS and one for NEXTSTEP.</font></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=9 height=10></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=9></td>

<td nowrap><font face="Times" size="+1"><img src="../../Images/bullet1.gif" width=4 height=8 vspace=3></font></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Leave current partitions alone, and use all unallocated space for NEXTSTEP. <b>fdisk </b>creates one new partition with the remaining space and installs NEXTSTEP on it.</font></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=9 height=10></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td width=9></td>

<td nowrap><font face="Times" size="+1"><img src="../../Images/bullet1.gif" width=4 height=8 vspace=3></font></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Replace the current DOS extended partition with a NEXTSTEP partition. For this, <b>fdisk </b>changes the function of the partition from extended to NEXTSTEP.</font></td></tr>

</table>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you want to partition your disk differently from these options, the installation software gives you the option to run <b>fdisk</b> interactively instead. (You'll still need to create a NEXTSTEP partition.)</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Using fdisk</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Ordinarily, you might not use <b>fdisk</b> after installation at all. Deleting a partition effectively erases all the files stored therein, so it's not something you'll do often. However, if you need to remove a partition, create a partition, or change the active partition, <b>fdisk</b> has an interactive mode that you can use.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><i>Important:</i> Back up any data you care about before you delete the partition that the data resides on.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b><i>Using fdisk's menu</i></b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">When you run <b>fdisk</b> interactively, it displays information about the current partitions and unallocated disk space, and a menu of what you can do. The information includes the type of data the partitions contain, the starting address of each partition in megabytes, the size of each partition in megabytes, and which is the active partition.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Choose menu items to make changes to the partitions. The changes you make aren't written until you explicitly save them. Once you save them, you need to reboot to see the changes.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica"><b><i>Using the non-interactive mode</i></b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Rather than using <b>fdisk</b>'s menu, you can call it with an inquiry or action to affect partitioning. This is useful for scripts that change partitioning, and is how the installation software uses <b>fdisk</b>. We don't expect many people to create scripts like this; however, if you're interested, the non-interactive mode is explained in the <b>fdisk(8)</b> man page.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Where else to look</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">For more information on NEXTSTEP <b>fdisk</b>, see the UNIX manual pages for <b>fdisk(8)</b> and <b>disk(8)</b>. For information on DOS <b>fdisk</b>, see your DOS documentation.</font>

<p><br><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2">FLIP/FLOPPING OPERATING SYSTEMS</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you're using NEXTSTEP on a PC and have a DOS partition, you might want to switch between using DOS and NEXTSTEP. Here's how to do it:</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>DOS to NEXTSTEP</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To switch from DOS to NEXTSTEP, you can either reboot and select NEXTSTEP, or you can use the utility <b>gonext</b>. This utility is provided on your Release 3.1 CD-ROM--it's <b>gonext.com</b> in <b>/usr/Dos</b>. To set it up, while you're in NEXTSTEP copy the file to your DOS partition, and make sure that the directory you store it in is listed in your DOS path (set in <b>autoexec.bat</b>). You can then run <b>gonext</b> from the DOS prompt:</font>

<p><font face="Courier" size="-1">C&gt; gonext</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">This is essentially the same as rebooting using the Reset key or typing <b>CTRL-ALT-DEL</b>. However, it boots NEXTSTEP without waiting for you to choose an operating system.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>gonext</b> doesn't try to shut down the system cleanly, so you shouldn't run it anytime you wouldn't feel comfortable hitting the Reset key (such as when you have unsaved documents). Even though Microsoft Windows, for example, disables <b>CTRL-ALT-DEL</b> as a reboot mechanism, it can't disable <b>gonext</b>.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>NEXTSTEP to DOS</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To switch from NEXTSTEP to DOS, you can run a DOS emulation application, or you can simply log out of NEXTSTEP and reboot in DOS.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2">CALIBRATING YOUR MONITOR</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Here's a cheap and easy way to adjust your screen to improve the appearance of images on it, by making sure it fits the assumptions NEXTSTEP makes about display linearity. The monitor must have brightness and contrast controls for this to work.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Three easy steps</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Here's what to do:</font>

<p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td nowrap><font face="Times"><b>1.</b></font></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Display an image like the one on the next page on your screen. The image must have tiles whose color is 44% gray, interleaved with patterned tiles whose patterns are made up of 44% white and 55% black pixels.</font></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td height=10></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td nowrap></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">(The image shown here is on the issue's floppy disk, in the file <b>MonitorCalibration.tiff</b>.)</font></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td height=10></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td nowrap><font face="Times"><b>2.</b></font></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">If you wear glasses, take them off. If not, squint or go stand across the room from your monitor. (This makes the next step a little tricky.)</font></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td height=10></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td nowrap><font face="Times"><b>3.</b></font></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1">Adjust the contrast and brightness controls until the image &quot;merges&quot; into a uniformly gray field. At some settings the pure gray tiles should appear brighter than the dithered tiles, while at other settings the dithered tiles should be brighter. You want to find the intermediate setting that merges the two types of tiles the best.</font></td></tr>

</table>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">When the whole image looks like it has a solid color, you're done.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>What's going on when you do this?</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">NEXTSTEP assumes that the display has linear intensity. In other words, it thinks that doubling the gray value of a pixel doubles the amount of energy coming off the screen.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Dithering is the technique of simulating a color by creating a pattern from the right proportion of other color dots. In this example, this means simulating an average shade of gray with black and white patches.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In the image, the dithered areas (those with the pattern) contain 44% white pixels and 55% black pixels, while the constant areas are made of all 44% gray pixels. When these areas appear equally bright, the settings on the monitor are considered linear, and dithering works optimally!</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Incidentally, this scheme only provides a very rough brightness and contrast adjustment. To make finer adjustments, you would need to use real color calibration hardware and software.</font>
