<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Welcome to the special 1993 NeXTWORLD Expo</font><font face="Helvetica" size="-2"><sup>SM</sup></font>&nbsp; <font face="Times" size="+1">issue of <i>NEXTSTEP In Focus</i>!</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you've been a <i>support bulletin</i> subscriber or just an occasional reader in the past, you may be wondering where that fine publication went, and what this is in its place.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><i>NEXTSTEP In Focus</i> is the reincarnation of the <i>support bulletin</i>. We've changed the name to reflect our changing audience--in addition to system administrators, we're providing information for other NEXTSTEP users.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2">...THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">What we haven't changed is the primary goal of this bulletin: to provide timely technical information. We want to help you better support your NeXT network or user community, and take advantage of all that NEXTSTEP has to offer.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To that end, we're continuing to bring you in-depth articles on things that aren't covered elsewhere. This includes background information that's not NEXTSTEP-specific but can help you understand why your computer does what it does. It also includes technical explanations of the nitty-gritty stuff, for those who want to get their hands dirty or just want to know.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">We're also still providing &quot;Tips &amp; Techniques,&quot; which tells you about neat tricks to use, traps to avoid, and new stuff that maybe hasn't made it into the NEXTSTEP documentation yet.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">As before, each subscription issue includes a floppy disk that holds an on-line version of the issue, along with any sample files discussed in the articles. The <i>support bulletin </i>disks used to include the latest version of NeXTanswers question-and-answer pairs, but we've moved that out to save space. (You can still get NeXTanswers--see &quot;Tips &amp; Techniques&quot; for details.)</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">So, while we do have a new name and new look, we're still giving you the information you need to make the most of NEXTSTEP. Our tag line, &quot;Support Bulletin for Users and System Administrators,&quot; says it all.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2">SPECIAL INTEL INFO</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To see what I mean, check out this issue.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Since this is the Expo issue, we decided to focus on what's on everyone's minds: NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors. If you're new to the PC world, &quot;Surviving DOS&quot; shows you the basics of using DOS; it has a side piece, &quot;Know the Lingo,&quot; that deciphers PC jargon. &quot;The Big Setup&quot; tells you what's happening inside the computer when you configure a PC. And &quot;How We Tested NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors&quot; gives you a sense of how solid this release is, so you know it's OK to try it.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">One article that's useful to everyone, not only Intel users, is &quot;Staying Secure.&quot; It's an overview of computer security, including what you should look out for and how to protect your computer or site. It also has a glossary of terms--if you've always wanted to know what's the difference between a virus, a worm, and a bomb, you're in luck.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">As always, &quot;Tips &amp; Techniques&quot; gives you nifty information and hints. &quot;FYI&quot; discusses some changes at NeXT that you should know about--new support options, new training, and who to call at NeXT for information and help.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+2">IT JUST GETS BETTER</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The good stuff doesn't stop there. Next issue we're focusing on NetInfo</font><font size="-1"><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></font><font face="Times" size="+1">--we'll cover everything about how to set up networks and keep them going. If you have NEXTSTEP on a network, you'll want to check it out.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">We hope you'll like the changes we've made, and that you'll find this issue helpful. If you have comments, questions, or suggestions, let us know!</font>
