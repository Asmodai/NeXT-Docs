<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>FAQ</b></font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>How much disk space does NEXTSTEP need?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">NEXTSTEP requires about 300 megabytes. If you want to do development work you need at least an additional 100 megabytes. If you want to have a DOS or Windows partition, take that into account as well. A safe bet would be to use a 500- to 600-megabyte drive.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Can NEXTSTEP run on a network?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">NEXTSTEP is a full client/server, peer-to-peer networking operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp; It supports several network protocols, including UUCP, TCP/IP, Novell NetWare, NetInfo, and NFS.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Can a portable PC run NEXTSTEP?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">Portables run NEXTSTEP well. See the <i>Hardware Compatibility Guide</i> for a list of compatible portables.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>If a floppy disk interface isn't supported, how can I save files?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">The <i>Hardware Compatibility Guide</i> states that &quot;the floppy disk interface is not supported.&quot; This means that the interface on the SCSI adapter doesn't work. However, all systems that NeXT supports have a floppy controller directly on the motherboard, and those floppy disk drives do work.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>What CD-ROM drives can I use with NEXTSTEP on a PC?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">Many standard, external, truly SCSI CD-ROM drives work with NEXTSTEP. Internal CD-ROM drives that manufacturers often offer with computer systems are usually IDE drives, and therefore don't work with NEXTSTEP.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Will my SCSI hard drive work with NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">Yes, if you use one of the supported SCSI adapter cards. See the <i>Hardware Compatibility Guide </i>for a list of supported adapters.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Will any SCSI tape drive work?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">Yes. Just about any standard, external, truly SCSI tape drive works with NEXTSTEP.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Can any VL-Bus, EISA, or ISA display adapter work with NEXTSTEP?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">No. For NEXTSTEP to recognize a display adapter, the adapter must communicate with the system through a device driver. Right now, we only have drivers for the adapters listed in the <i>Hardware Compatibility Guide</i>. We can't guarantee that an unlisted adapter will work, even if it claims to use the same instructions as a supported adapter.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Is there a &quot;software compatibility guide?&quot;</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">There's a booklet included with all copies of NEXTSTEP called <i>Third-Party Products for NEXTSTEP</i>. It lists the software products released or planned for NEXTSTEP as of June 1993.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">As a general rule, if a company hasn't written software specifically for NEXTSTEP, it won't run under NEXTSTEP. However, using the SoftPC application from Insignia Solutions, you can run almost any DOS or Windows program under NEXTSTEP.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Do I have to start up Windows separately from NEXTSTEP?</b></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1">Yes. A PC can run under either DOS or NEXTSTEP, but not both at the same time. SoftPC from Insignia Solutions is an emulation program that allows you to use DOS or Windows programs inside a NEXTSTEP window, but if you want to use only Windows, you will need to start it up separately.</font>
