<p><font face="Times" size="+4">The New SoftPC</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Bob Lawton</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><i>NeXT has worked closely with Insignia Solutions to bring a high-quality, high-performance emulation application to NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors.</i></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><i>You may have read about it in the press. . .now check&nbsp; it out for yourself in NEXTSTEP Release 3.2. By running all your Windows applications inside a NEXTSTEP window, you can have the best of both worlds, in one seamlessly integrated environment!</i></font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Overview</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In the 1990s, a major shift is occurring as corporations move from mainframes to client/server networks. Factors responsible for this evolution include the economics of low-cost MIPS on workstations and PCs, high-speed networking, the arrival of advanced 32-bit operating systems like NEXTSTEP, and a new generation of client/server applications.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>The problem: Incompatibility</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Even as the technology evolves, 90 percent of personal productivity applications, including spreadsheets, desktop publishing programs, and word processors, run on DOS or Windows. Abandoning these applications and the PC infrastructure that supports them would be costly and time-consuming.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">What's needed is a bridge between the two environments. Such a bridge must allow users on workstations and PCs to access data created on DOS and Windows and to run their legacy applications. Companies depend on the PC infrastructure, with its many applications, vendors, and industry-wide standards. They need to preserve the investment they've made in their DOS and Windows environments.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>The solution: Emulation</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Emulation--the ability to make one computer behave like another--is the bridge. SoftPC from Insignia Solutions provides an emulation bridge by bringing DOS and Windows compatibility to NEXTSTEP. SoftPC provides 100 percent DOS and Windows software compatibility. In effect, SoftPC creates a virtual PC within NEXTSTEP.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>In a window or full screen</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">SoftPC for NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors can run in two modes: Window and full screen.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In window mode, SoftPC runs in a window within the regular NEXTSTEP workspace, so that DOS or Windows applications run side by side with NEXTSTEP applications.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In full screen mode, SoftPC takes over the whole screen, so the computer looks as if it's running DOS or Windows. However, NEXTSTEP applications continue to run in the background, and you can flip back to window mode anytime you want to use a NEXTSTEP application. Full screen mode provides near native performance of DOS and Windows applications.</font>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Cutting and pasting</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">In window mode you can cut and paste text between NEXTSTEP and Windows applications, just as you do between NEXTSTEP applications. You can even copy graphics from Windows to NEXTSTEP, but not from NEXTSTEP to Windows. (Some display drivers may not support cutting and pasting.)</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Note:</b> Full screen mode currently doesn't support cutting and pasting between Windows or DOS and NEXTSTEP applications.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Compatibility with existing applications</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">SoftPC supports all real and standard mode DOS and Windows DPMI (DOS Protected Mode Interface) compliant applications--most DOS and Windows applications run in real or standard mode, or are DPMI compliant.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The current version of SoftPC doesn't run Windows in enhanced mode, so applications that require either enhanced mode or complete hardware control--for example, other operating systems like OS/2</font><font size="-1"><sup>&reg;</sup></font> <font face="Times" size="+1">and Windows NT</font><font size="-1"><sup><img src="../../Images/c12.gif" width=17 height=3><sup>TM</sup></sup></font><font face="Times" size="+1">--aren't currently supported.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Insignia's extensive testing program ensures compatibility with the latest versions of the most popular DOS and Windows applications.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">SoftPC also includes networking support through SoftNode, which supports Novell NetWare</font><font size="-1"><sup>&reg; </sup></font><font face="Times" size="+1">(SPX/IPX) and Novell LAN Workplace</font><font size="-1"><sup>&reg;</sup></font> <font face="Times" size="+1">(TCP/IP).</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Running applications</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">You can launch DOS applications directly from the NEXTSTEP workspace--SoftPC automatically starts up and runs whatever DOS application you double-click. You can run additional DOS applications at the same time by running additional copies of SoftPC.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To run Microsoft Windows applications, you launch SoftPC from the NEXTSTEP workspace, and then start up Windows in either window mode or full screen mode--you can set a default mode in <b>AUTOEXEC.BAT</b> . Once Windows is running, you launch Windows applications from the Windows File Manager or Program Manager as usual.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Because SoftPC supports the complete Microsoft Windows 3.1 environment, you can run as many Windows applications as you want within a single SoftPC session.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Performance</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">SoftPC takes advantage of the native Intel processor to maximize performance. Unlike SoftPC for NeXT computers, the Intel version doesn't emulate a CPU; instead, applications interact directly with the hardware. As a result, many DOS and Windows applications perform as well under NEXTSTEP as they would on a high-end 80386 or low-end i486 computer.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Insignia has worked with NeXT to increase not only raw CPU performance but also graphics performance. For example in window mode, SoftPC uses a NeXT-developed technology to improve the performance of applications. This technology allows SoftPC to access the graphics display frame buffer directly for highest performance.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Even better, in full screen mode SoftPC directly accesses the built-in VGA graphics hardware. This allows applications to run with nearly the same performance as on a regular Windows or DOS system.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>Future directions</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">SoftPC provides the equivalent of a PC/AT running in the NEXTSTEP environment. Insignia and NeXT have optimized SoftPC to provide the best PC emulation possible. Currently, NeXT and Insignia are exploring ways to further accelerate applications running under NEXTSTEP.</font> <font face="Times" size="-1">n</font>
