<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><i>NeXT's Support group can help you solve your NEXTSTEP problems. To make the most of</i></font><br>
<font face="Times" size="+1"><i>your call to Support, you should have the relevant information right at hand. It also helps to understand how the group works and what its members do to answer your questions.</i></font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+3"><b>Welcome to Support</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Almost everyone who uses computers realizes the importance of technical support. Although great software tries to make it as easy as possible for you to do your work, a helping hand always enables you to do more.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The NeXT Support group provides you with this kind of assistance. Whether you're building a mission-critical custom application or converting your business to the client/server networking model, we're here to help you tackle your technical challenges.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+3"><b>What We Do and What We Offer</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The Support group at NeXT helps people find specific solutions to problems they come across after purchasing NEXTSTEP. The questions we handle are like these:</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="-2"><sup>n</sup></font> <font face="Times" size="+1">&quot;How can I get my copy of NEXTSTEP installed on my Intel computer?&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="-2"><sup>n</sup></font> <font face="Times" size="+1">&quot;How do I change the IP address of my Netinfo server?&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="-2"><sup>n</sup></font> <font face="Times" size="+1">&quot;How can I improve the performance of graphics operations in my custom app?&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="-2"><sup>n</sup></font> <font face="Times" size="+1">&quot;How can I best manage the use of distributed objects across my company network?&quot;</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Our support is delivered to you through several products. Our most accessible product comes to you at no charge: It's the NeXTanswers</font><font size="-1"><sup><sup>TM</sup></sup></font> <font face="Times" size="+1">information retrieval service. Through various automated means--e-mail, anonymous <b>ftp</b>, and phone--NeXTanswers gives you direct access to well-documented technical information 24 hours a day.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If the information you need isn't documented in NeXTanswers, you can still get an answer from other support offerings. If you want to pay as you go, you can use our Pay-per-Call program. If you want to get unlimited support through our 800 number for a year, you can purchase a Hotline contract. And if you need occasional on-site support and a designated engineer who works directly with you, you can purchase our Premium Support service.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Regardless of which support product you choose, though, you are assured of getting high-quality, informed technical support. Moreover, our team constantly monitors many sources of information, including NeXT's software engineering, quality and testing, and marketing and sales departments; external publications such as <i>NeXTWORLD</i></font><font size="-1"><sup>&reg;</sup></font><font face="Times" size="+1">; the Internet; and you, the support customer. We use all of this information to address the problems and questions that you present us.</font>

<p><font face="Times"><i>To find out more about our support products, please see the NEXTSTEP Support &amp; Education Catalog.</i></font><br>
<img src="../../Images/sp.gif" width=3 height=1><font face="Times"><i>To find out how to use NeXTanswers, see &quot;How to Talk to NeXT&quot; in the FYI department.</i></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+3"><b>Before You Call</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">To make the most of your call to NeXT Support, there are few things you can do before you call. First, check the NEXTSTEP documentation and NeXTanswers. We've tried to cover all the questions most people have. It's to your advantage to use these resources, because they're the fastest way to get current information and they're free.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you can't find the answer to your question in NeXTanswers, the next step is to call us.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Information to have in front of you</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">But wait! Before you make that phone call, please make sure you have the necessary information on hand, so we can answer your question as quickly as possible:</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you're calling Support to help someone else, make sure you get this information from that person before you call us.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Taking these steps will ensure that you receive the most timely, informative help.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Making the call</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">There are a couple of ways you can request support. One is to use e-mail, sending your request to <b>ask_next@next.com</b>. You can provide more detailed information to our engineers through e-mail than you can over the phone. The other way to request support is to call 1-800-848-NeXT and choose the option for Support. (Outside the United States, call your nearest NeXT representative.)</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">For urgent problems that involve a lot of detail, it's best to send e-mail first and follow up with a phone call. That will help us to understand the severity of your problem.</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+3"><b>When You Call</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Unless you have a Premium Support contract, all of your requests for support are channeled through the Frontline support team. When you call Support, you're greeted by an engineer who handles frequently asked questions and solves problems that can be addressed quickly.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">The first thing the engineer does is determine what your problem is and document everything you say. After the engineer has an idea of what your problem is, he or she verifies whether you have a support contract or takes a credit card number. After documenting your problem, the engineer tries to solve it quickly.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If that engineer can't solve your problem immediately, the engineer handling your call puts a log of the problem into our call database and arranges for another engineer to call you back. The follow-up engineer can then spend time researching and solving the problem.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Once your call log is in our system, you're assured a response time consistent with the severity of your problem. We have three severity levels in Support:</font>

<p>

<table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0>

<tr valign=top>

<td nowrap><font face="Times" size="-2"><sup>n</sup></font></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Severity 3:</b> General query or problem.</font></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td height=10></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td nowrap><font face="Times" size="-2"><sup>n</sup></font></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Severity 2:</b> Problem that hinders you but doesn't prevent you from getting work done.</font></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td height=10></td></tr>

<tr valign=top>

<td nowrap><font face="Times" size="-2"><sup>n</sup></font></td>

<td><font face="Times" size="+1"><b>Severity 1:</b> System down in a production environment.</font></td></tr>

</table>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Before your initial call ends, the Frontline engineer discusses with you the severity of your problem and gives you a log number that you can reference on return calls. Keep a record of this information until your problem is resolved.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+3"><b>Getting Back to You</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Because our engineers work on a call-back basis, they may have occasional problems catching you by phone. To prevent possible &quot;phone tag,&quot; leave as many different ways to contact you as possible--fax numbers, pager numbers, home phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and so on. That way, we can reach you by whatever means is quickest.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">We don't like leaving messages any more than you do, so if you think it's becoming a problem, please let us know.</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Whatever your problem, we'll do as much as we can to help you solve it. Generally we won't walk you through a documented procedure, but we'll help you with any specific problems you have. Note that if your problem is caused by your using unsupported hardware, you'll be charged for all of the time spent solving your problem. (The <i>Hardware Compatibility Guide</i> lists all of the systems we currently support.)</font>

<p><font face="Times"><i>The Hardware Compatibility Guide is available on NeXTanswers.&nbsp; Request document #1002</i></font><font face="Times" size="+1">.</font>

<p><br><br>

<p><font face="Times" size="+3"><b>Here to Help You</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">Whenever you get in a bind, don't know where to start, or get stuck in a dead end, that's when you can call on NeXT Support. Remember--we're here to help!</font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">If you'd like to discuss our procedures and policies, or suggest how we could change them to match your business style better, please contact me. We're always looking for ways to meet our customers' needs!</font>

<p><br><br><br>

<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+3"><b>What to Know Before You Call</b></font>

<p><font face="Times" size="+1">By providing the following information about your problem or question, you can help us help you resolve it more quickly.&nbsp; For example, if you tell us the type of interface your Database Kit, application uses to get to your database, we can resolve your programming issues faster. Similarly, if you're having a problem installing our software on an Intel machine, we're able to be more helpful if we know your hardware configuration.</font>
